# Asteroids

This is the second Python based project from the Python/Go Backend Path via. Boot.Dev
Project has been completed as instructed, but I definitely want to add a scoring system, because otherwise the game is just a husk.
Below is the note that was C3:L7 regarding their ideas for expansion. I do plan on coming back to this later, adding some music/SFX, probably checking all these boxes off by the time I'm done. For now though, I'm rather enjoying speedrunning the course. Depending on how GitHub holds/shows timestamps, you might see I've finished what was supposed to be an eight hour course here in just under an hour and a half.

## Extending the Project

You've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make the project your own, here are some ideas:

- [ ] Add a scoring system  
- [ ] Implement multiple lives and respawning
- [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
- [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- [ ] Add a background image
- [ ] Create different weapon types
- [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- [ ] Add a shield power-up
- [ ] Add a speed power-up
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped

Have fun with it, and make sure to share any improvements you make with us in the Discord community!
